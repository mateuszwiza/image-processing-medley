# Image and Video Processing Projects

A collection of 4 projects I completed for a university course. The projects concern topics such as spacial filtering, geometric transformations, frequency filtering, Fourier Transform, noise removal, image restoration, data compression, morphological processing, binarization, and Motion Enegry Images (MEI).

## Contents:
### Project 1:
* *prewitt.py* - first order gradient spatial mask edge detection.
* *canny.py* - Canny edge detection.
* *noise_edge.py* - edge detection using 1st and 2nd order methods in noisy images.
* *polar.py* - transforming image from cartesian to polar coordinates.
* *warping.py* - image warping.

### Project 2:
* *Task1_1.m* - 2D Fourier Transform of simple periodic signal
* *Task1_2.m* - Fourier Transform of periodic image
* *Task2.m* - Periodic noise removal
* *Task3.m* - Image restoration

### Project 3:
* *task1.py* - Huffman Coding algorithm
* *task2.py* - Otsuâ€™s Binarization Algorithm and Opening/Closing transformations

### Project 4:
* *MEI_analysis.py* - loading the video, creating MEIs, morphological transformations, edges extraction, Hu Moments, shape comparison
